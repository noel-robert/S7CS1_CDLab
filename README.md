This repository contains programs done as part of Compiler Design Lab [CS1U48A].



###### Experiment 01 - Lexical Analyzer using DFA

Here, our aim is to create a C program that works as a Lexical Analyzer. Run the below terminal commands from main repository location to run the code. Provide inputs in /Exp_01/inputFile.txt

```
cd Exp_01
gcc lexicalAnalyzer.c -o lexicalAnalyzer.out
./lexicalAnalyzer.out
```


###### Experiment 03 - Recursive Descend Parser

Write a C program to implement a recursive descend parser for the given language.
