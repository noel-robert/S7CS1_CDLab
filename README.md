This repository contains programs done as part of Compiler Design Lab [CS1U48A].



###### Experiment 01 - Lexical Analyzer using DFA
Write a C program that works as a Lexical Analyzer. Run the below terminal commands from main repository location to run the code. Provide input C program in /Exp_01/inputFile.txt

```
cd Exp_01
gcc lexicalAnalyzer.c -o lexicalAnalyzer.out
./lexicalAnalyzer.out
```

###### Experiment 02 - Lexical Analyzer using LEX Tool
Use LEX tool to implement a lexical analyzer
2.1 - Lexical Analyzer using LEX tool
2.2 - Count number of words from a set of strings
2.3 - Get number of vovels in a string

Navigate to the folder where your program is, and use the following commands to use LEX tool.
```
lex <filename>.l
gcc lex.yy.c -ll
./a.out
```
